# kpack Helm Chart
A helm chart to install [`kpack`](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack).


## Prerequisites Details

1. A Kubernetes cluster version 1.14 or later
1. [kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
1. Cluster-admin permissions for the current user
1. Accessible Docker V2 Registry


## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tybritten/kpack-helm.git
$ helm install my-release kpack-helm/kpack
```

Ensure that the kpack controller & webhook have a status of `Running` using  `kubectl get`.   

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --namespace kpack --watch
```

## Deleting the Release

Delete the Helm deployment as normal

```
$ helm delete my-release
```

*Note:* This Chart includes CRDs which Helm3 will not delete automatically. To remove these manually, type:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f kpack/crds/release-0.0.7.yaml
```
Since Helm cannot upgrade CRDs, you must Delete the release and the CRDs using this command before installing the new version.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the `kpack` chart and their default values. Update the `values.yaml` with the desired options. You do not need `git` credentials for public code repositories.

With these settings, `kpack` is setup and you can create image builds with `Image` manifests. If you want to also configure those builds as part of the helm deployment, also configure it in the `values.yaml.` It currently supports github repositories and blob as [source options](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/master/docs/image.md).
